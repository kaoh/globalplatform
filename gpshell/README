Title    : Global Platform Shell (GPShell)
Authors  : snitmo@gmail.com

License  : See file COPYING
Requires : GlobalPlatform http://sourceforge.net/projects/globalplatform/
           PC/SC Lite http://www.musclecard.com/ (for UNIXes)
           OpenSSL http://www.openssl.org/
           zlib http://www.zlib.net/
******************************************************

GPShell is a script interpreter which talks to a smart card.  It is written on top of the GlobalPlatform library, which was developed by Karsten Ohme.
It uses smart card communication protocols ISO-7816-4 and OpenPlatform 2.0.1 and GlobalPlatform 2.1.1.
It can establish a secure channel with a smart card, load, instantiate, delete, list applets on a smart card.

You need also the libraries GlobalPlatform 6.0.0, zlib 1.2.3 (zlib1.dll) and OpenSSL >= 0.9.8e (libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll) or
compatible and must place them in the directory where GPShell is called or better the system directory (C:\Windows\System32 or /usr/(local/)lib usually).
You also need at least one connection plugin, e.g. the shipped "gppcscconnectionplugin" to use PC/SC.

For MacOSX you might set

export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/local/lib

so that all needed libraries are found.

------------------

If you experience problems a DEBUG output is always helpful.
Set the variable GLOBALPLATFORM_DEBUG=1 in the environment. You can set
the logfile with GLOBALPLATFORM_LOGFILE=<file>. Under Windows by
default C:\Temp\GlobalPlatform.log is chosen. The log file must be
writable for the user. The default log file under Unix systems is
/tmp/GlobalPlatform.log. But usually syslog is available and this will
be used by default, so you may have to specify the log file manually,
if you don't have access to the syslog or don't want to use it.
Keep in mind that the debugging output may contain sensitive information,
e.g. keys!

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PLEASE OBEY THAT EVERY CARD GETS LOCKED AFTER A FEW (USUALLY 10) UNSUCCESSFUL MUTUAL AUTHENTICATIONS.
THE CONTENTS OF A LOCKED CARD CANNOT BE MANAGED ANYMORE (DELETED, INSTALLED)!!!
IF YOU EXPERIENCE SOME UNSUCCESSFUL MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION ATTEMPS FIRST EXECUTE A SUCCESSFUL MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION WITH A KNOWN WORKING PROGRAM
TO RESET THE RETRY COUNTER BEFORE YOU PROCEED WITH GPSHELL. CHECK THE PARAMETERS FOR MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION (KEYS, SECURITY PROTOCOL) AND ASK IF ANYBODY KNOWS IF THE CARD IS SUPPORTED.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

------------------

If you compile this on your own:

Compilation under Unix
----------------------

You must have CMake installed. http://www.cmake.org/ 
This can be obtained in standard Unix distributions over the integrated package system.

On a command line type:

cd \path\to\globalplatform
cmake .
make
make install

FreeBSD
-------

Under FreeBSD the pcsc-lite libraries are not detected automatically. So you have to specify the locations:

cmake -DPCSC_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/local/include -DPCSC_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/lib/libpcsclite.so

Compilation under Windows
-------------------------

After changing CMake parameters you must rebuild the files and delete the CMakeCache.txt file.

-- Requirements --

Tested with:

* Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition
* VISUAL C++ 2010 EXPRESS

**** VISUAL C++ 2010 EXPRESS ****
To have nmake install VISUAL C++ 2010 EXPRESS
http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2010-express

**** Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition ****
https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs

**** SDK ****
Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924

**** Windows Driver Kit (WDK) - Only needed for platform independend builts ****
The WDK is needed to build a Windows platform independent version without getting into conflict with different
Windows msvcrt DLL versions.

See http://kobyk.wordpress.com/2007/07/20/dynamically-linking-with-msvcrtdll-using-visual-c-2005/

**** OpenSSL ****
http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
--> Win32 OpenSSL v1.0.1c or higher
--> Visual C++ 2008 Redistributables might be necessary
  * Let it install the DLLs to the Windows system directory

**** zlib ****
http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/index.html
--> zlib pre-built DLL and sources, version 1.2.5

  * Copy the zlibwapi.dll to C:\Windows\System32
  
**** VISUAL C++ 2010 EXPRESS ****
  * Copy zlib.h and zconf.h from the sources of zlib to
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include
  * Copy the file "zlibwapi.lib" from the lib directory to
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Lib

**** Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition ****
	
  * Copy zlib.h and zconf.h from the sources of zlib to
	C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Include\um
  * Copy the file "zlibwapi.lib" from the lib directory to
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\Lib\winv6.3\um\x86
	
Note: The paths given here are working only with VC 2010 or VC 2013 respectively. 
This path must be adjusted. When the command prompt of visual studio is open execute "set" and look for an 
environment variable "WindowsSdkDir". This value should be taken instead as serach path for the right 
sub directories.
    
**** CMake ****
http://www.cmake.org/
--> CMake 2.8.10.2 or higher

**** Compile ****

  * Launch Visual Studio Command Prompt (VS 2010) or Developer Command Prompt for VS2013 (VS 2013)
  * cd \path\to\gpshell

  * cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" for a release version
  * cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DDEBUG=1 for a debug version  
  * ## CMake looks for PC/SC, OpenSSL and zlib ##
    
  * nmake  
   
  * To build it downwards compatible you have to use a different set of common 
    runtime libraries contained in the Windows Driver Development Kit. You have
    to specifx with -DWINDDK_DIR the path to the DDK.  
  * Complete example:
    cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DWINDDK_DIR=C:\WinDDK\7600.16385.1
    nmake     

  * Done! 


Source Packages
---------------

Execute:

make/nmake package_sourse

Binary Packages
---------------

Execute:

make/nmake package 

Documentation
-------------

Execute:

cmake .
make/name doc

Ubuntu/Debian packages
----------------------

You must also have dput, pbuilder and debhelper installed.

Execute:

cmake .
make package_ubuntu

The script ubuntu-package.sh iterates over all Ubuntu series and creates dsc files for Debian package creation or Launchpad uploads.

---

You can also upload the automatically created sources.changes to Launchpad. You must be registered there and you must have a .dput.cf in place. Follow the instructions on https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/Uploading

Execute:

make dput

If you have used the ubuntu-package.sh script you must manually upload the source.changes files.

Execute:

dput gpsnapshots-ppa gpshell_1.4.4+5SNAPSHOT20120524080448+0200-0ubuntu1~precise.changes

---

You can create a Ubuntu/Debian package from a dsc file.

Execute:

dpkg-source -x gpshell_1.4.4+5SNAPSHOT20120524080448+0200-0ubuntu1~precise.dsc
cd gpshell-1.4.4+5
fakeroot debian/rules binary

CMake Issues
------------ 

You must rebuild the build system if your build tools have changed. Otherwise 
CMake uses outdated values. You have to delete manually 
the CMakeCache.txt file (and maybe also the CMakeLists directory and 
cmake_install.cmake).

If your are using Cygwin and you have installed the GNU compiler tools and the
bin directory is on the PATH environment variable CMake will favor these tools 
and the linking step will fail. So remove the Cygwin bin directory from the path.
